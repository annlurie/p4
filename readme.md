#Readme File for Project 4 (Ann Lurie)

**Project URL:** [http://p4.annlurie.me](http://p4.annlurie.me)

**Project Description:**
This is a database-driven application for task management built using the Laravel framework. It allows users to create tasklists and add tasks to them. The tasks are created as 'incomplete' and can be updated in two ways: to edit the content of the task (short or long description) and to mark it complete. Tasks can also be deleted from a list. Completed tasks can no longer be edited from the list view (though a complete task can be rendered in the 'update' view directly via a route parameter).
The main view in the app is 'List' which shows completed and incomplete tasks (with relevant view/edit/delete) links, as well as a form to add new tasks to an existing list.

**Demo Information:**

**Details for TA/Instructor:**

Use the /seed route to quickly create and populate a single list. A number of lists have been created already on the Production site.

Bootstrap remnants exist in the codebase, but I ended up stripping it out in frustration - couldn't get all views to properly render via Bootstrap and it was easier to work without it.
